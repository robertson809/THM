Questions and Notes

! Questions

! can't figure out how to compile the module in a different file 
! and still have the program that uses it find it

! are you not allowed to add allocate an array in a module?


!End Questions

!Notes

!to compile a program, use gfortran [program name]
!to run a program type ./[filename]
! use lapack for any actually linear algebra
! 1.d0 is a intrinsic fortran double
! 1.e0 is an intrinsic fortran single
! parameter tag makes it a final, it doesn't change throughout
! four parts of fortran code: function, program, subroutine, and module
!End Notes

To get lots of warnings, use gfortran -Wall tridiag.f90 tridiag_driver.f90 
You compile the module and the driver in the same line


!Questions

Should scalar multiplication change the matrix or just return the new value
Throwing/handling errors?

Not sure why size was an argument of print method, could easily do it without.

How do you create an allocatable array of user defined data types?

Should we assume that there's decreasing degree matrix polynomials, or should entry in the MP array include the degree of the coefficient

Should I do Horner's recursively?
