! use lapack for any actually linear algebra
! 1.d0 is a intrinsic fortran double
! 1.e0 is an intrinsic fortran single
! parameter tag makes it a final, it doesn't change throughout
!End Notes

To get lots of warnings, use gfortran -Wall tridiag.f90 tridiag_driver.f90 
You compile the module and the driver in the same line
