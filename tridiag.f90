! This is the tridiagonal matrix polynomial program
! use lapack for any actually linear algebra
! lapak written in the 70s, core basis of matlab

! A bit tautologic here, define dp as the kind that a double is
! this just takes whatever this system calls a double and then
! makes dp that

! 1.d0 is a intrinsic fortran double
! 1.e0 is an intrinsic fortran single
! parameter tag makes it a final, it doesn't change throughout
! the program
integer, parameter  :: dp = kind(1.d0)
